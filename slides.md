### Finding primary sources

#### JumboSearch
You can use *subject terms* to find primary sources in JumboSearch. Just pair the appropriate subject term with your keywords.

#### Primary source databases

#### Evaluating a database
* What is the geographic and temporal scope of the database?
* What kinds of primary sources does the database contain?
* What questions can I answer using this database?
* Is the database easy to use?

#### Example database
* [History Vault](https://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?location=proquesthistoryvault)

#### Group work: Evaluate the following:
* [Slavery and Anti-Slavery: A Transnational Archive](https://go-gale-com.ezproxy.library.tufts.edu/ps/start.do?p=SAS&u=mlin_m_tufts)
* [Migration to New Worlds](https://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?location=migrationtonewworlds)
* [American Indian Newspapers](https://www-americanindiannewspapers-amdigital-co-uk.ezproxy.library.tufts.edu/)
* [Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/)
* [Family Stories from the Trail of Tears](https://ualrexhibits.org/tribalwriters/artifacts/Family-Stories-Trail-of-Tears.html#Carnes)
* [The Freedman's Bureau Online](http://freedmensbureau.com/)
* [Immigrant Ships Transcribers Guild](http://www.immigrantships.net)

### General suggestions for searching databases
1. Use key words from your topic: who, what, where, when...
2. Start with specific terms, but use general terms if necessary.
3. See if there is a "browse" option to discover what is in the database
4. Pay attention to search fields, i.e. "search anywhere", "geography", "personal name" etc.


### Contextualizing primary sources

1. Examine the primary source

    * What kind of primary source is it?
    * Who created it?
    * What assumptions are reflected in it?
    * Why was it created?
    * What can I learn from this primary source?
    * What information does this primary source conceal?

2. Use reference sources for contextual or background information for the primary source.

3. Find secondary sources useful for interpreting your primary source.

* Pro-tip: How to find town histories:
    * search by subject heading in this format: "town (state abr.) history
    * Ex. "Morristown (tenn.) history"
    * [Guide to state abbreviations](https://www.loc.gov/cds/desktop/cheatsheets/provinces_states_abbreviations.pdf)

4. Place the primary source in conversation with other relevant primary sources
